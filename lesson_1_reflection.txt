How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was very helpfull.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will help developer to roll back changes anytime if something did not work as expected and saves lot of time

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
	If I forget to save automatic save would save my changes automaticaly but 
	Manual save would be more appropriatae and prevent excecive file changes.
    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    google docs are just docs not codes. While Git you save perticular commit when there s some related change in many files and which can affect the system if they are not changed together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use them to compare versions on the files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    we can always compare to old version and rollback to that version of the file and work on it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    create some files and commit thoes files and test all history and compare the changes and go back to thoes version
